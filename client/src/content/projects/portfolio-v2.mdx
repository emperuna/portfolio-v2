## 1.0 Executive Summary

Portfolio V1 remained functionally stable but suffered from **representation drift**:  
while the operator’s capabilities had evolved toward system design, infrastructure thinking, and operational awareness, the public interface continued to present a feature-centric narrative.

**Portfolio V2** was initiated as a corrective action to eliminate this mismatch.

This upgrade prioritizes _how systems are thought about_, not merely _what they do_.

## 2.0 Problem Statement

The previous architecture optimized for implementation proof:

- Feature completeness
- UI correctness
- Stack familiarity

However, it failed to communicate:

- Architectural boundaries
- Trade-off awareness
- Failure modeling
- Observability-first thinking

This created a false signal to external reviewers.

## 3.0 Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Frontend: Astro + React (Islands)

Astro was selected to enforce clear separation between static representation and dynamic behavior.

Interactive components are deliberately isolated and hydrated only when necessary, mirroring real-world cost-aware system design rather than defaulting to full client-side execution.

### 3.2 Backend: Flask (Simulated Telemetry)

A lightweight backend exposes system state and health indicators.

While the data is simulated, the interfaces, contracts, and polling patterns reflect real operational systems — emphasizing correctness of _mental models_ over production scale.

## 4.0 Key Capabilities Introduced

- **Mission Control Interface**  
  A centralized system status view designed to mirror how operators reason about live systems.

- **Incident Log Narrative**  
  Structured reporting used as a storytelling mechanism to communicate decision-making, not just outcomes.

- **System Visualization Layer**  
  Visual abstractions used to explain relationships, dependencies, and flow — not decorative animation.

## 5.0 Outcome

Portfolio V2 successfully repositions the operator from a feature-focused implementer to a system-oriented engineer.

Latency is minimal.  
Complexity is intentional.  
The interface now reflects how the system is _thought about_, not merely how it is rendered.

## 6.0 Closing Note

This incident was not triggered by failure.

It was triggered by growth.
