<CreativeLayout title="Modules | Portfolio v2">
    {/* Optional: We can reuse HeroBackground but maybe dim it or change it? 
        Let's keep it consistent for the cockpit feel but maybe simpler? 
        For now, reusing it is fine, but we might want it fixed/shared in layout. 
        Since it's in a page, it will re-mount. With ViewTransitions, if we put it in Layout with transition:persist, 
        it would stay. But user didn't ask for that yet. I'll put it here.
